# uscis-status-check-scraper-master
uscis status check from automatic scraper master file created by Kevin in April 2023

## Purpose?
to check uscis case everytime manually online is a no-go for me; so I've developed this python scripts to get multiple case status and case details via web scraper and compile everythin into a combined csv/excel file ending with today's date; this will help people track cases quickly without some hiccups I went through before

## How to use it?
There are two steps to use it:
1. After download, create a text file(.txt) under the same folder with your case number as contents and your name as the file name (or multiple txt files including your spouse)
2. run the "scraper_uscis_status.exe" execution file (remember it needs to be put under the same folder with your input text file) even if you don't have python installed on your computer; otherwise, you can run scraper_uscis_status.py code with python to get the same results

## Security?
The code is absolutely not taking any of your privacy, all it requires is case ids in text file and it pulls case status for you

## What to expect?
the scripts will help you get as many cases as your input and save them in a combined csv/excel file under the same folder with names, form, case id, case status and case details as below
