# uscis-status-check-scraper-master
uscis status check from automatic scraper master file created by Kevin in April 2023

## Purpose?
to check uscis case everytime manually online is a no-go for me; so I've developed this python scripts to get multiple case status and case details via web scraper and compile everythin into a combined csv/excel file ending with today's date; this will help people track cases quickly without some hiccups I went through before

## How to use it?
There are two steps to use it:
1. After download, create a text file(.txt) under the same folder with your case number as contents and your name as the file name (or multiple txt files including your spouse)
2. run the "scraper_uscis_status.exe" execution file (remember it needs to be put under the same folder with your input text file) even if you don't have python installed on your computer; otherwise, you can run scraper_uscis_status.py code with python to get the same results

## Security?
The code is absolutely not taking any of your privacy, all it requires is case ids in text file and it pulls case status for you

## What to expect?
the scripts will help you get as many cases as your input and save them in a combined csv/excel file under the same folder with names, form, case id, case status and case details as below

## How to read the Receipt Number ?
The USCIS Receipt notice generated is sent to applicants as ‘Form I-797C, Notice of Action‘. The top of the receipt notice indicates this form number and details. The I-797C form generated has an indication on it that says ‘Notice Type‘ as ‘Receipt Notice‘, which confirms that it is a USCIS Receipt Notice.
The Receipt notice also has details about the application or case type, the received date, receipt number, applicant name, and other important information. The applicant or attorney, who files the application with USCIS gets the physical copy of the receipt notice mailed to them.

USCIS receipt number that is generated by the USCIS online case management system is based on a set of criteria to indicate where it is being processed, when it was filed, etc. It is a 13-digit number. The receipt number always starts with 3 alphabets like LIN, MSC, EAC, WAC, etc. It is followed by a 10-digit number.
Center list:

EAC – Eastern Adjudication Center (now known as Vermont Service Center)

IOE – USCIS online account (efile)

LIN – Lincoln Service Center (now known as Nebraska Service Center)

MSC – Missouri Service Center (now known as National Benefits Center)

SRC – Southern Regional Center (now known as Texas Service Center)

WAC – Western Adjudication Center (now known as California Service Center)

YSC – Potomac Service Center

USCIS Receipt Number has two main formats. The format depends on the filing location of the application or petition with USCIS as listed below :

### (i). USCIS Service Centers - (shortname as SC)
Receipt Number Format : XXX-XX-XXX-5-XXXX
Example : EAC-21-123-5-0345 (This is: Center-Year-Day-Code-Series)

### (ii). USCIS Lockbox Location - (shortname as LB)
Receipt Number Format : XXX-XX-9-XXX-XXXX
Example : MSC-22-9-001-2345 (This is: Center-Year-Code-Series-SubSeries)
